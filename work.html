      <h4 class="company_caption">Digital Main Street Program - Communitech</h5> <br> <br>
      <p> In my first software job I was a part of 2 teams each consisting of a UX/UI designer, business/marketing analysts, copy writer 
        and digital media coordinator to help main street businesses negatively affected by the Pandemic. As the Web Developer I helped create/modify 
        these businesses websites and helped with any technial issues. &nbsp<span class="expand_text_inline">(Click to Expand)</span></p>
      <p class="hidden-text"> <br><br> We worked in 4 week stints with each business and worked with up to 4 at once. Working so closely with 
        these small businesses that had been negatively affected by Covid-19 made the business relations personal. It was very fulfilling 
        to know the work I was doing - whether that be setting up shipping, creating an online platform or researching to improve sale conversion - 
        was directly helping real people and their livelihoods </p>
